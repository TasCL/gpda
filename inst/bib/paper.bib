For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple genetic algorithm for numerical optimization in real parameter spaces. In a statistical context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. This paper integrates the essential ideas of DE and MCMC, resulting in Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC). DE-MC is a population MCMC algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. DE-MC solves an important problem in MCMC, namely that of choosing an appropriate scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In DE-MC the jumps are simply a fixed multiple of the differences of two random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. The selection process of DE-MC works via the usual Metropolis ratio which defines the probability with which a proposal is accepted. In tests with known uncertainty distributions, the efficiency of DE-MC with respect to random walk Metropolis with optimal multivariate Normal jumps ranged from 68{\%} for small population sizes to 100{\%} for large population sizes and even to 500{\%} for the 97.5{\%} point of a variable from a 50-dimensional Student distribution. Two Bayesian examples illustrate the potential of DE-MC in practice. DE-MC is shown to facilitate multidimensional updates in a multi-chain ``Metropolis-within-Gibbs'' sampling approach. The advantage of DE-MC over conventional MCMC are simplicity, speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of automatic bandwidth selection for a kernel density estimator is considered. It is well recognized that the bandwidth estimate selected by the least squares cross-validation is subject to large sample variation. This difficulty limits the application of the cross-validation estimate. Based on characteristic functions, an important expression for the cross-validation bandwidth estimate is obtained. The expression clearly points out the source of variation. To stabilize the variation, a simple bandwidth selection procedure is proposed. It is shown that the stabilized bandwidth selector gives a strongly consistent estimate of the optimal bandwidth. Under commonly used smoothness conditions, the stabilized bandwidth estimate has a faster convergence rate than the convergence rate of the cross-validation estimate. For sufficiently smooth density functions, it is shown that the stabilized bandwidth estimate is asymptotically normal with a relative convergence rate n-1/2 instead of the rate n-1/10 of the cross-validation estimate. A plug-in estimate and an adjusted plug-in estimate are also proposed, and their asymptotic distributions are obtained. It is noted that the plug-in estimate is asymptotically efficient. The adjusted plug-in bandwidth estimate and the stabilized bandwidth estimate are shown to be asymptotically equivalent. The simulation results verify that the proposed procedures perform much better than the cross-validation for finite samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Author SummaryDynamic systems biology models typically involve many kinetic parameters, the quantitative determination of which has been a serious obstacle to using these models. Previous work showed for a particular model that useful predictions could be extracted from a fit long before the experimental data constrained the parameters, even to within orders of magnitude. This was attributed to a “sloppy” pattern in the model's parameter sensitivities; the sensitivity eigenvalues were roughly evenly spaced over many decades. Consequently, the model behavior depended effectively on only a few “stiff” parameter combinations. Here we study the converse problem, showing that direct parameter measurements are very inefficient at constraining the model's behavior. To yield effective predictions, such measurements must be very precise and complete; even a single imprecise parameter often destroys predictivity. We also show here that the characteristic sloppy eigenvalue pattern is reproduced in 16 other diverse models from the systems biology literature. The apparent universality of sloppiness suggests that predictions from most models will be very fragile to single uncertain parameters and that collective parameters fits can often yield tight predictions with loose parameters. Together these results argue that focusing on parameter values may be a very inefficient route to useful models.},

This article provides functions for the S-PLUS package that produce maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for the ex-Wald, as well as for the shifted Wald and ex-Gaussian, distributions. In a Monte Carlo study, the efficiency and bias of parameter estimates were examined. Results indicated that samples of at least 400 are necessary to obtain adequate estimates of the ex-Wald and that, for some parameter ranges, much larger samples may be required. For shifted Wald estimation, smaller samples of around 100 were adequate, at least when fits identified by the software as having ill-conditioned maximums were excluded. The use of all functions is illustrated using data from Schwarz (2001).

  Abstract                 = {A critical task in modeling is to determine how well the theoretical assumptions encoded in a model account for observations. Bayesian methods are an ideal framework for doing just this. Existing approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods however rely on often insufficient “summary statistics”. Here, I present and analyze a highly efficient extension of the recently proposed (Turner and Sederberg 2014) Probability Density Approximation (PDA) method, which circumvents this insufficiency. This method combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation with tools from non-parametric statistics to improve upon existing ABC methods. The primary contributions of this article are: (1) A more efficient implementation of this method that substantially improves computational performance is described. (2) Theoretical results describing the influence of methodological approximation errors on posterior estimation are discussed. In particular, while this method is highly accurate, even small errors have a strong influence on model comparisons when using standard statistical approaches (such as deviance information criterion). (3) An augmentation of the standard PDA procedure, termed “resampled PDA”, that reduces the negative influence of approximation errors on performance and accuracy, is presented. (4) A number of examples of varying complexity are presented along with supplementary code for their implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the real world, decision making processes must be able to integrate non-stationary information that changes systematically while the decision is in progress. Although theories of decision making have traditionally been applied to paradigms with stationary information, non-stationary stimuli are now of increasing theoretical interest. We use a random-dot motion paradigm along with cognitive modeling to investigate how the decision process is updated when a stimulus changes. Participants viewed a cloud of moving dots, where the motion switched directions midway through some trials, and were asked to determine the direction of motion. Behavioral results revealed a strong delay effect: after presentation of the initial motion direction there is a substantial time delay before the changed motion information is integrated into the decision process. To further investigate the underlying changes in the decision process, we developed a Piecewise Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (PLBA). The \{PLBA\} is efficient to simulate, enabling it to be fit to participant choice and response-time distribution data in a hierarchal modeling framework using a non-parametric approximate Bayesian algorithm. Consistent with behavioral results, \{PLBA\} fits confirmed the presence of a long delay between presentation and integration of new stimulus information, but did not support increased response caution in reaction to the change. We also found the decision process was not veridical, as symmetric stimulus change had an asymmetric effect on the rate of evidence accumulation. Thus, the perceptual decision process was slow to react to, and underestimated, new contrary motion information. },

  Abstract                 = {Decisions about sensory stimuli are often based on an accumulation of evidence in time. When subjects control stimulus duration, the decision terminates when the accumulated evidence reaches a criterion level. Under many natural circumstances and in many laboratory settings, the environment, rather than the subject, controls the stimulus duration. In these settings, it is generally assumed that subjects commit to a choice at the end of the stimulus stream. Indeed, failure to benefit from the full stream of information is interpreted as a sign of imperfect accumulation or memory leak. Contrary to these assumptions, we show that monkeys performing a direction discrimination task commit to a choice when the accumulated evidence reaches a threshold level (or bound), sometimes long before the end of stimulus. This bounded accumulation of evidence is reflected in the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex. Thus, the readout of visual cortex embraces a termination rule to limit processing even when potentially useful information is available.},

This high degree of information usage allows the estimation of different parameters mapping cognitive components such as speed of information accumulation or decision bias. For three of the four main parameters (drift rate, starting point, and non-decision time) trial-to-trial variability is allowed. We investigated the influence of these variability parameters both drawing on simulation studies and on data from an empirical test-retest study using different optimization criteria and different trial numbers. Our results suggest that less complex models (fixing intertrial variabilities of the drift rate and the starting point at zero) can improve the estimation of the psychologically most interesting parameters (drift rate, threshold separation, starting point, and non-decision time).},

Some of these researchers also assume that the parameters of these distributions uniquely correspond to specific cognitive processes. We studied the validity of this cognitive interpretation by relating the parameters of the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to those of the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model whose parameters have well-established cognitive interpretations. In a simulation study, we fitted the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to data generated from the diffusion model by systematically varying its parameters across a wide range of plausible values. In an empirical study, the two descriptive distributions were fitted to published data that featured manipulations of task difficulty, response caution, and a priori bias. The results clearly demonstrate that the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters do not correspond uniquely to parameters of the diffusion model. We conclude that researchers should resist the temptation to interpret changes in the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters in terms of cognitive processes.

  Abstract                 = {Examines the possibility that the components of an information-processing system all operate continuously, passing information from one to the next as it becomes available. A model called the "cascade model" is presented and shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model, experimental manipulations may have either or both of 2 effects on a processing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality of the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of processes is described. The model is then used to reexamine the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. Results include the finding that factors that affect the rates of 2 different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model, whereas 2 factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. Factors that affect asymptotic output, however, tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. A new method is presented for analyzing processes in cascade, which extends the additive factors method to an analysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy.

Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor. The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.},

In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data—accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions—into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

The standard deviations in the parameter values can be used as measures of the variability in parameter estimates from fits to experimental data. We introduced contaminant reaction times and variability into the other components of processing besides the decision process and found that the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods failed, sometimes dramatically. But the weighted least squares method was robust to these two factors. We then present results from modifications of the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods, in which these factors are explicitly modeled, and show that the parameter values of the diffusion model are recovered well. We argue that explicit modeling is an important method for addressing contaminants and variability in nondecision processes and that it can be applied in any theoretical approach to modeling reaction time.},

Their capacity to recover both the mean structure and individual differences in parameter values was explored. The three methods were applied to simulated data generated by the diffusion model, by the leaky, competing accumulator (LCA) model (Usher \&amp; McClelland, 2001) and by the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model (Brown \&amp; Heathcote, 2008). Results show that EZ and DMAT are better capable than fast-dm in recovering experimental effects on parameters. EZ was best in recovering individual differences in parameter values. When data were generated by the LCA model, the diffusion model estimates obtained with all three methods correlated well with corresponding LCA model parameters. No such one-on-one correspondence could be established between parameters of the LBA model and the diffusion model.},

  Abstract                 = {I present a diffusion model for decision making in continuous report tasks, in which a continuous, circularly distributed, stimulus attribute in working memory is matched to a representation of the attribute in the stimulus display. Memory retrieval is modeled as a 2-dimensional diffusion process with vector-valued drift on a disk, whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion. The direction and magnitude of the drift vector describe the identity of the stimulus and the quality of its representation in memory, respectively. The point at which the diffusion exits the disk determines the reported value of the attribute and the time to exit the disk determines the decision time. Expressions for the joint distribution of decision times and report outcomes are obtained by means of the Girsanov change-of-measure theorem, which allows the properties of the nonzero-drift diffusion process to be characterized as a function of a Euclidian-distance Bessel process. Predicted report precision is equal to the product of the decision criterion and the drift magnitude and follows a von Mises distribution, in agreement with the treatment of precision in the working memory literature. Trial-to-trial variability in criterion and drift rate leads, respectively, to direct and inverse relationships between report accuracy and decision times, in agreement with, and generalizing, the standard diffusion model of 2-choice decisions. The 2-dimensional model provides a process account of working memory precision and its relationship with the diffusion model, and a new way to investigate the properties of working memory, via the distributions of decision times.},

  Abstract                 = {When people make decisions, do they give equal weight to evidence arriving at different times? A recent study (Kiani et al., ) using brief motion pulses (superimposed on a random moving dot display) reported a primacy effect: pulses presented early in a motion observation period had a stronger impact than pulses presented later. This observation was interpreted as supporting the bounded diffusion (BD) model and ruling out models in which evidence accumulation is subject to leakage or decay of early-arriving information. We use motion pulses and other manipulations of the timing of the perceptual evidence in new experiments and simulations that support the leaky competing accumulator (LCA) model as an alternative to the BD model. While the LCA does include leakage, we show that it can exhibit primacy as a result of competition between alternatives (implemented via mutual inhibition), when the inhibition is strong relative to the leak. Our experiments replicate the primacy effect when participants must be prepared to respond quickly at the end of a motion observation period. With less time pressure, however, the primacy effect is much weaker. For 2 (out of 10) participants, a primacy bias observed in trials where the motion observation period is short becomes weaker or reverses (becoming a recency effect) as the observation period lengthens. Our simulation studies show that primacy is equally consistent with the LCA or with BD. The transition from primacy-to-recency can also be captured by the LCA but not by BD. Individual differences and relations between the LCA and other models are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Many influential memory models are computational in the sense that their predictions are derived through simulation. This means that it is difficult or impossible to write down a probability distribution or likelihood that characterizes the random behavior of the data as a function of the model’s parameters. In turn, the lack of a likelihood means that these models cannot be directly fitted to data using traditional techniques. In particular, standard Bayesian analyses of such models are impossible. In this article, we examine how a new procedure called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a method for Bayesian analysis that circumvents the evaluation of the likelihood, can be used to fit computational models to memory data. In particular, we investigate the bind cue decide model of episodic memory (Dennis \& Humphreys, 2001) and the retrieving effectively from memory model (Shiffrin \& Steyvers, 1997). We fit hierarchical versions of each model to the data of Dennis, Lee, and Kinnell (2008) and Kinnell and Dennis (2012). The ABC analysis permits us to explore the relationships between the parameters in each model as well as evaluate their relative fits to data—analyses that were not previously possible.},

Such estimation techniques are crucial to the understanding of simulation-based models, whose likelihood functions may be difficult or even impossible to derive. However, current approaches are limited by their dependence on sufficient statistics and/or tolerance thresholds. In this article, we provide a new approach that requires no summary statistics, error terms, or thresholds and is generalizable to all models in psychology that can be simulated. We use our algorithm to fit a variety of cognitive models with known likelihood functions to ensure the accuracy of our approach. We then apply our method to two real-world examples to illustrate the types of complex problems our method solves. In the first example, we fit an error-correcting criterion model of signal detection, whose criterion dynamically adjusts after every trial. We then fit two models of choice response time to experimental data: the linear ballistic accumulator model, which has a known likelihood, and the leaky competing accumulator model, whose likelihood is intractable. The estimated posterior distributions of the two models allow for direct parameter interpretation and model comparison by means of conventional Bayesian statistics—a feat that was not previously possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a simulation-based method for estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters of a model. The \{ABC\} approach is instrumental when a likelihood function for a model cannot be mathematically specified, or has a complicated form. Although difficulty in calculating a model’s likelihood is extremely common, current \{ABC\} methods suffer from two problems that have largely prevented their mainstream adoption: long computation time and an inability to scale beyond a few parameters. We introduce differential evolution as a computationally efficient genetic algorithm for proposal generation in our \{ABC\} sampler. We show how using this method allows our new \{ABC\} algorithm, called ABCDE, to obtain accurate posterior estimates in fewer iterations than kernel-based \{ABC\} algorithms and to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces that have proven difficult for current \{ABC\} methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Among the most valuable tools in behavioral science is statistically fitting mathematical models of cognition to data---response time distributions, in particular. However, techniques for fitting distributions vary widely, and little is known about the efficacy of different techniques. In this article, we assess several fitting techniques by simulating six widely cited models of response time and using the fitting procedures to recover model parameters. The techniques include the maximization of likelihood and least squares fits of the theoretical distributions to different empirical estimates of the simulated distributions. A running example is used to illustrate the different estimation and fitting procedures. The simulation studies reveal that empirical density estimates are biased even for very large sample sizes. Some fitting techniques yield more accurate and less variable parameter estimates than do others. Methods that involve least squares fits to density estimates generally yield very poor parameter estimates.},

The software is readily accessible from the popular scripting languages MATLAB and R (both 64-bit). The speed obtained on a single high-end GPU is comparable to that of a small CPU cluster, bringing standard statistical inference of complex diffusion models to the desktop platform.},
