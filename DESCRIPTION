Description: Use general purpose graphics processing uit (GP-GPU) to conduct  
    massive Monte Carlo simulations of basic and piece-wise linear ballistic 
    accumulator models. The simulations are then used to approximate the model 
    likelihood via a slihgtly modified method described in Homles (2015).
